## Summary
Kings Crossing is a mobile application inspired by the ancient game of Checkers. With roots dating back 5000 years, and a modern form that's about 800 years old, this project brings the timeless strategy game to your fingertips. Players take turns to outmaneuver and capture their opponent's pieces, with the app tracking scores until one emerges victorious.
